- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Starting from this homework, I feel that the logic of OOP finally makes sense to me. I now better understand the relationship between classes, constructors, and how objects interact with each other. The concept of encapsulation became much clearer while working on this assignment. I began to see how each class is responsible for its own data and behavior, and how other classes should interact with it only through public methods rather than directly modifying its internal variables.

I especially enjoyed the train example because it was very visual. I could clearly imagine the relationship between the Engine, Cars, Passengers, and the Train itself. This helped me understand how different objects communicate responsibilities.

At the beginning, I was very stuck on the “implements requirement” part. I kept seeing red squiggly lines under my constructor and class name, and I didn’t understand why. After searching online, I realized that it was because I had not fully implemented all the required methods from the interface. 

After figuring that out, I noticed that all four classes follow a similar logical structure: define private fields, write a constructor to initialize them, and then implement methods that operate on those fields. Seeing this repeated pattern helped me feel more confident.

For future students:
For students who struggled with A2 and A3, I would actually recommend looking at A4 earlier. This assignment felt more intuitive to me because the object relationships are concrete and easier to visualize. It helped me understand the structure and logic of Java coding in a more organized way.
