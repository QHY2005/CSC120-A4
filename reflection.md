Starting from this hw, I feel like the logics makes way more sense to me. Since I finally understand the relationship between class, constructor and OOP. I really love this train example, since I can visualize the internal relationships of engine, car, passenger and train. Initially I was really stucked by how to implement requirement part in to different java doc and there will always be a red guigle line under the name of constuctor and then by seraching on google i learned that it is because i didnt fully use all the things that needs to be in the class, aka not implementing the surfaces from requirement compeletely.

After figuring out that everything makes sense to me and I think all 4 classes basically follow the same logic chain, define the intial value, ,,,etc.

I would recommend students who struggled with A2,3 to do A4 first, since I think this one is more intuitively and makes me understand the java coding logistics better.
